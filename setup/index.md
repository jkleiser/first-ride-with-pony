## Chapter 1: Setup

In this chapter we will create a new project and setup a sane development
environment.

Our project starts as a simple Hello World and we will add tests, talk a bit
about generated documentation and add a simple Makefile to orchestrate the
whole thing. By the end of the chapter we'll be ready to dive into real code.
