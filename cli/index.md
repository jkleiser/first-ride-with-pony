## CLI

As a long time UNIX user, I use almost only CLI, except when it comes to browse
the web, watch a video or edit images. Every language I give a try are
disqualified if there's no simple standard way to parse the command line, load
configuration files, output data and log.

Fortunately, albeit young, Pony provides simple yet usable APIs in its standard
lib for these tasks. I guess a great package could be written to avoid
boilerplate code, and do lots of the plumbing we're about to do, but stdlib is
enough for us at the moment.

This chapter is much less dense in terms of Pony concepts, but is a way to dive
into stdlib and to explore idioms and common patterns. And to write some more 
Pony code :).
