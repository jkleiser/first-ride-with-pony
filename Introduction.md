## Why Pony?

Short answer: because it's fun and fresh.

## What is Raft?

Citing [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Raft_(computer_science)):
"Raft is a consensus algorithm designed as an alternative to Paxos. It was
meant to be more understandable than Paxos by means of separation of logic, but
it is also formally proven safe and offers some new features.[1] Raft offers a
generic way to distribute a state machine across a cluster of computing
systems, ensuring that each node in the cluster agrees upon the same series of
state transitions."

The main resource to Raft is the [reference
paper](https://ramcloud.stanford.edu/wiki/download/attachments/11370504/raft.pdf)
and throughout this tutorial we will base our implementation on this paper, and
hopefully achieve a full-spec implementation.

A lot of resources are available at https://raft.github.io/ and the reader
doesn't have to read the long reference paper to start the tutorial. This [10
minutes tour](http://thesecretlivesofdata.com/raft/) greatly enough to
understand where the tutorial goes.

## Who are you?

Just a Free Software enthusiast, seeking The Perfect Programming Language.

I mostly work with Python and C and played a bit with hipsters stuff like
Go and Rust.

## Can I help?

Yes! Fork me and send a metric ton of pull request goodness. You may also
fill an issue on [github](https://github.com/lisael/first-ride-with-pony)
As I hope you did not guess yet, I'm not a native english speaker, I won't
get upset at all if the PR/issue is about grammar, spelling or vocabulary.
